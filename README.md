# Fundamental Data Structures & Algorithms

This branch points to some old data structure implementations. Lacking
the level of genericity and utility of other examples, they are,
however, very fundamental and easy to understand.

The examples can be built with Make and reside in the `bin/` directory.

```sh
make
```
