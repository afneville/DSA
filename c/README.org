Implementation of various important data structures and algorithms in the C language.

* Directory Structure & Build Commands

For many small to medium size C projects, it is very convenient to split source files across three sub-directories, according to their purpose. =./inc/= is for header files, =./src/= is for generic source files, and =./run/= is for source files for which an executable should be generated.

├──bin/

├──inc/
│  ├──item.h
│  └──list.h
├──obj/
│  ├──item.o
│  └──list.o
├──run/
│  └──test.c
├── src/
│  ├──item.c
│  ├──list.c
│  └──tree.c

#+end_src

The project root directory contains the makefile. =compile_commands.json= exists for language server configuration, GCC is used in the makefile. The clean target of make will fully remove the binary and object file directories. Fully rebuilding the project in a single command:

#+begin_src sh
make clean && make
#+end_src
